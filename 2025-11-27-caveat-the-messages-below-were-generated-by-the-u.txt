I need you to execute a multi-step deployment to my active Blender session 
using the Blender MCP tools. 

We are deploying the "K1-Lightwave" Digital Twin. You have access to the 
source scripts I just attached (or can find in the `03_Scripts_MCP` 
directory).

**Your Mission:**
1. **Read & Analyze:** First, read the content of `setup_scene.py` to ensure
 you have the full Python code string.
2. **Execute Phase 1 (Foundation):** Use your Blender MCP tool (likely 
`execute_python` or `run_python_script`) to inject and execute the *full 
content* of `setup_scene.py`. 
   - *Goal:* This must reset the render settings, create the materials 
(Red/Gunmetal/Steel), and set up the lighting rig.
3. **Execute Phase 2 (Assignment):** Immediately after Phase 1 succeeds, 
read and execute the content of `apply_materials.py` via the same MCP tool.
   - *Goal:* This assigns the materials based on my object names (Chassis, 
Leg, Badge) and creates the "Hero" camera.
4. **Validation:** After execution, use the Blender MCP tool 
`get_scene_info` (or equivalent) to list the objects and confirm that 
`Cam_Hero_1` exists and is the active camera.

**Critical Instruction:** Do not try to run these via the bash `blender 
--background` command. I want you to execute this *live* into my open 
Blender window using the MCP connection.

⏺ I'll help you deploy the K1-Lightwave Digital Twin to your active Blender
  session. Let me first check what Blender MCP tools are available.

⏺ Bash(claude mcp list 2>/dev/null || echo "Checking MCP tools via other
      method")
  ⎿ System: Darwin Elroys-MacBook-Pro.local 25.1.0 Darwin Kernel Version 25

⏺ Let me check if there's a Blender MCP server configured:

    _T6041 arm64
    … +36 lines (ctrl+o to expand)



⏺ I see you have MCP servers configured, but I don't see a Blender MCP
  server in your current settings. Let me check if there's one configured in
   the project directory:

⏺ Search(pattern: "**/*.json", path: "~/K1-Lightwave_Digital-Twin")
  ⎿  Found 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Search(pattern: "**/.mcp*", path: "~/K1-Lightwave_Digital-Twin")
  ⎿  Found 0 files 

⏺ Read(.claude/settings.local.json)
  ⎿  Read 11 lines

⏺ I don't see a Blender MCP server configured in your environment. For me to
   execute Python code directly into your live Blender session, you need a
  Blender MCP server running.

  Let me check if you have any Blender-related MCP tools or addons
  installed:

⏺ Bash(pip list 2>/dev/null | grep -i blender; brew list 2>/dev/null | grep -i
      blender; ls /Applications/ 2>/dev/null | grep -i [Bb]lender)
  ⎿ System: Darwin Elroys-MacBook-Pro.local 25.1.0 Darwin Kernel Version 25

    … +3 lines (ctrl+o to expand)



⏺ Search(pattern: "**/blender*mcp*", path: "/Users/spectrasynq")
  ⎿  Found 0 files 

⏺ Issue Found: You have Blender installed, but there's no Blender MCP server
   configured or running that would allow me to inject Python code directly
  into your live Blender session.

  To execute code live in your open Blender window, you need one of these
  options:

  Option 1: Install a Blender MCP Server

  You can install blender-mcp which creates a bridge between Claude and your
   Blender instance:

  # Install the Blender MCP addon
  pip install blender-mcp

  # Then configure it in ~/.claude/settings.json under mcpServers

  Option 2: Use Blender's Built-in Python Server

  Enable Blender's remote Python execution via a socket server addon.

  Option 3: Manual Execution (Immediate Workaround)

  I can prepare the full Python code as copy-paste ready scripts that you
  can execute in Blender's Text Editor or Python Console.

  ---
  Which would you like me to help with?

  1. Install blender-mcp - I'll guide you through the setup
  2. Prepare copy-paste scripts - I'll format the code ready for manual
  execution in Blender

  If you believe you already have a Blender MCP running, please let me know
  the tool name or check if it's listed when you run /mcp in Claude Code.

> I've just installed blender-mcp via pip. Go ahead and configure the reset 

⏺ I'll configure the Blender MCP server in your Claude settings. Let me
  update the configuration:

⏺ Read(~/.claude/settings.json)
  ⎿  Read 34 lines

⏺ Update(~/.claude/settings.json)
  ⎿  Updated ../.claude/settings.json with 4 additions                   
       28          "headers": {
       29            "Authorization": "Bearer add5aef855edd2f313ac6a3c877
            e1cd4dbd3243801c59b5d06354b788f381e1a"
       30          }
       31 +      },
       32 +      "blender": {
       33 +        "command": "uvx",
       34 +        "args": ["blender-mcp"]
       35        }
       36      }
       37    }

⏺ Blender MCP server configured.

  Next steps to activate:

  1. Restart Claude Code - Run /exit then restart the CLI for the new MCP
  server to load
  2. In Blender - Make sure the blender-mcp addon is enabled:
    - Open Blender → Edit → Preferences → Add-ons
    - Search for "MCP" or "blender-mcp"
    - Enable it if not already enabled
    - The addon should start a local server that Claude can connect to
  3. Come back here - After restarting, I'll have access to tools like
  mcp__blender__execute_python and mcp__blender__get_scene_info to deploy
  your K1-Lightwave Digital Twin live.

  Quick check: Does blender-mcp require the Blender addon to be installed
  separately, or did the pip install handle both? If you need help
  installing the Blender addon side, let me know.
